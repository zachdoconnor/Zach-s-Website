			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>I'm a recent graduate from Indiana University's Luddy School of Informatics. My passion for technology was developed while taking a coding elective, leading me to fall in love with building websites using HTML and CSS. This experience shaped my decision to pursue a bachelor's degree in Informatics, combining my interests in technology and its interaction with people.</p>
			<p>During my undergraduate studies, I had the opportunity to intern at VMS BioMarketing. Here, I furthered the development of my technical skills in engineering and data analysis, playing a key role in developing and testing a new Salesforce Org to enhance efficiency and functionality. My work also involved setting up a foundation for a marketing system in Salesforce, strengthening VMS’s organization and outreach strategies. This experience not only improved my technical skills but also my communication and teamwork abilities.<p>
			<p>After graduating, my interest in how business and technology influence each other led me to continue my education at the Kelley School of Business. I'm currently pursuing a master's degree in Information Systems (MSIS), a challenge I embraced to bridge the gap between technology and business. The program, known for its intensity, has already shown me significant growth in my professional capabilities.</p>
			<p>In my personal life, I'm a proud Indianapolis native (Go Colts!) and an active member of my local community. When not immersed in school work, I enjoy playing golf, hitting the gym, and spending quality time at the dog park with my pug.</p>
			<p>As I venture into the professional world, I aim to leverage my expertise in data analysis and business acumen to create impactful solutions in the workplace. I am eager to contribute to diverse and innovative teams, fostering an environment of mutual growth and success. I believe that my unique blend of technical knowledge and business insight will be an asset in tackling complex business challenges through technology.</p>
